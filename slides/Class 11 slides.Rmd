## Assignments

* Assignment 5 due this Thursday

* Make sure to fix submission errors for prior assignments



## When submitting assignments

* Make sure your RMarkdown "output type" is set to "github_document" (this will create an .md file when you knit rather than .html)
* Do not put `echo=FALSE` , `include=FALSE`, or `eval=FALSE` in your exercise code chunks. These will tell R to either not show your code, not show your plots, or not run the code at all. We need to see your code AND output for grading
* Knit your RMarkdown document - this will create the .md file
* Commit/push the RMarkdown (.Rmd), the knitted file (.md), AND the assignment "files" folder (this consists of the plot images - your plots will not appear in your knitted document if you do not push this folder)


## First recap and wrap-up: 
## Tidy data



## Exercise

* Convert the coronavirus dataset to a wider format where the confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases are shown in separate columns
 
* With this wide format data, make a bar chart of the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per day for the US



## Conclusion

>If I had one thing to tell biologists learning bioinformatics, it would be “write code for humans, write data for computers”.

## Learning objectives

By the end of today’s class, you should be able to:

* Read data files into R with a variety of readr functions
* Parse different types of data and make sure R is interpreting your variable types correctly
* Use janitor::clean_names() to make column headers more manageable
* Write text output to your disk
* Save plots


## Data import functions

* `read_csv()` reads comma delimited files, `read_csv2()` reads semicolon separated files, `read_tsv()` reads tab delimited files, and `read_delim()` reads in files with any delimiter.

* `read_fwf()` reads fixed width files. You can specify fields either by their widths with `fwf_widths()` or their position with `fwf_positions()`. `read_table()` reads a common variation of fixed width files where columns are separated by white space.




## Why use the tidyverse/readr import functions instead of base-R?

* They are typically much faster (~10x) than their base-R equivalents (e.g. `read.cvs()`)

* They produce tibbles, they don’t convert character vectors to factors, use row names, or munge the column names

* They are more reproducible. Base R functions inherit some behaviour from your operating system and environment variables, so import code that works on your computer might not work on someone else’s.



## Data types

* logical: contains only “F”, “T”, “FALSE”, or “TRUE”.
* integer: contains only numeric characters (and -).
* double: contains only valid doubles (including numbers like 4.5e-5).
* number: contains valid doubles with the grouping mark inside.
* time: matches the default time_format.
* date: matches the default date_format.
* date-time: any ISO8601 date.


## Why numbers can be tricky

* People write numbers differently in different parts of the world. For example, some countries use . in between the integer and fractional parts of a real number, while others use ,.

* Numbers are often surrounded by other characters that provide some context, like “$1000” or “10%”.

* Numbers often contain “grouping” characters to make them easier to read, like “1,000,000”, and these grouping characters vary around the world.
