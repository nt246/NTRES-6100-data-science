## Learning objectives for today's class

By the end of todayâ€™s class, students are expected to be able to:

-   Generate documents with Quarto, and render these documents to html with RStudio.
-   Use the visual editor to combine text, code, tables and plots in Quarto documents, and understand the underlying markdown syntax
-   Demonstrate at least two Quarto code chunk options
-   Configure git to integrate with RStudio

## Quarto files are designed to be used in three ways:

-   For communicating to decision-makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

-   For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

-   As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern-day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.
