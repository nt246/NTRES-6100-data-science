## Learning objectives for today's class

By the end of today’s class, students are expected to be able to:

-   Generate documents with Quarto, and render these documents to html with RStudio.
-   Use the visual editor to combine text, code, tables and plots in Quarto documents, and understand the underlying markdown syntax
-   Demonstrate at least two Quarto code chunk options
-   Configure git to integrate with RStudio

## Quarto files are designed to be used in three ways:

-   For communicating to decision-makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

-   For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

-   As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern-day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.


## Text formatting

Notice the syntax for:

- **headers** with `#`, `##`, ..., `#######`
- **bold** with `**text**`
- *italic* with `*text*`
- `verbatim code` with `` `text` ``
- <span style="color: red;">change text color with</span>`<span style="color: red;">text</span>`
- [link a url to your text with](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/a5/cd/e8a5cd9c5dbccfabcdeea5c4a16e5e10.png) `[text](url)`
- insert a blank line with `<br>`

To see more of the rules, let's look at RStudio's built-in reference. Let's do this: Help > Markdown Quick Reference


## Activity
Make the following changes to your RMarkdown document:

* Add some italic text
* Make a numbered list
* Add some subheaders

You can find hints in the Markdown Quick Reference (in the menu bar: Help > Markdown Quick Reference). 

Re-knit your html file to see how your formatting works out. If you have more time, try adding a URL and a table
