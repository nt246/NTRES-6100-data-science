## End-of-class presentations

You will all have the opportunity to give a short presentation during our last class (required if you're taking the course for credit)

<br>

We would like each of you to give a very brief (1.5 mins) presentation showing the rest of the class either:

* One or several ways in which you have already implemented something from the class in your own work, or

* An overview of changes you plan to make in your workflow moving forward.



## Assignments

* Assignment 6 due this Thursday

* Make sure to fix submission errors for prior assignments



## When submitting assignments

* Make sure your RMarkdown "output type" is set to "github_document" (this will create an .md file when you knit rather than .html)
* Do not put `echo=FALSE` , `include=FALSE`, or `eval=FALSE` in your exercise code chunks. These will tell R to either not show your code, not show your plots, or not run the code at all. We need to see your code AND output for grading
* Knit your RMarkdown document - this will create the .md file
* Commit/push the RMarkdown (.Rmd), the knitted file (.md), AND the assignment "files" folder (this consists of the plot images - your plots will not appear in your knitted document if you do not push this folder)


## Learning objectives 

By the end of today's class, you should be able to:

* Combine information from multiple tables into one
* Describe the difference between the four `join` and two `filter` functions in `dplyr`
* Select and apply the appropriate `join` function in common use scenarios


## Row binding

Usually works when it should (especially with `dplyr::bind_rows()`) and usually doesn’t when it shouldn’t


## Column binding

Column binding is much more dangerous because it often “works” when it should not. It’s your job to the rows are aligned and it’s all too easy to screw this up.


## Exercise

Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights



## Exercise
You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve learned above.
