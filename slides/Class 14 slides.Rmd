## Change of course schedule


## Assignments

* Assignment 7 due this Thursday

* Updated assignment schedule



## Learning objectives 

We'll start by working through a few exercises on using integrating data from multiple tibbles (using `join()` functions) and recap on strategies for successfully integrating relational data. Then we'll shift gears to begin exploring the key programming concepts of iteration and conditional execution.

By the end of today's and next Tuesday's class, you should be able to:

* Write a `for` loop to repeat operations on different input
* Implement `if` and `if else` statements for conditional execution of code
