Assignment 6: Data import and tidy data
================

## Instructions: Please read through this before you begin

- This homework is due by **10pm on Thursday 10/09/2025**. Please upload
  it using your personal GitHub repository for this class.

- Please name your R markdown file `assignment_6.Rmd` and the knitted
  markdown file `assignment_6.md`.

- For this assignment, please **reproduce this markdown file** using R
  markdown. This includes the followings:

  - **Reproduce this markdown template**, except for this list of
    instructions which you **don’t** have to include. Pay attention to
    all the formatting in this file, including bullet points, bolded
    characters, inserted code chunks, headings, text colors, blank
    lines, etc.

  - Have all your code embedded within the R markdown file, and show
    **BOTH your code and plots** in the knitted markdown file.

  - Use R Markdown functionalities to **hide messages and warnings when
    needed**. (Suggestion: messages and warnings can often be
    informative and important, so please examine them carefully and only
    turn them off when you finish the exercise).

- Please note that you only need to finish **three out of the five**
  questions in **Exercise 1** in order to get credit for that exercise.
  Also, **Exercise 3** is **optional**.

- To start, first load all the required packages with the following
  code. Install them if they are not installed yet.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

## Exercise 1. Tibble and Data Import

Import the data frames listed below into R and
[parse](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#parsing-a-vector) the
columns appropriately when needed. Watch out for the formatting oddities
of each dataset. Print the results directly, **without** using
`kable()`.

**You only need to finish any three out of the five questions in this
exercise in order to get credit.**

<br>

#### 1.1 Create the following tibble manually, first using `tribble()` and then using `tibble()`. Print both results. \[We didn’t have time to cover this in class, but look up how these functions work [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html#creating-tibbles)\]

`tribble()`:

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##       a     b c     
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <chr> 
    ## 1     1   2.1 apple 
    ## 2     2   3.2 orange

`tibble()`:

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##       a     b c     
    ##   <int> <dbl> <chr> 
    ## 1     1   2.1 apple 
    ## 2     2   3.2 orange

<br>

#### 1.2 Import `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/dataset2.txt` into R. Change the column names into “Name”, “Weight”, “Price”.

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   Name   Weight Price
    ##   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 apple       1   2.9
    ## 2 orange      2   4.9
    ## 3 durian     10  19.9

<br>

#### 1.3 Import `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/dataset3.txt` into R. Watch out for the first few lines, missing values, separators, quotation marks, and deliminaters.

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   Name   Weight Price
    ##   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 apple       1   2.9
    ## 2 orange      2  NA  
    ## 3 durian     NA  19.9

<br>

#### 1.4 Import `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/dataset4.txt` into R. Watch out for comments, units, and decimal marks (which are `,` in this case).

    ## Warning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
    ## e.g.:
    ##   dat <- vroom(...)
    ##   problems(dat)

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   Name   Weight Price
    ##   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 apple       1   2.9
    ## 2 orange      2   4.9
    ## 3 durian     10  19.9

<br>

#### 1.5 Import `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/dataset5.txt` into R. Parse the columns properly. As a reminder, you can read about parsing date and time data [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#readr-datetimes). Write this imported and parsed data frame into a new csv file named `dataset5_new.csv` in your `problem_sets` folder.

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   Name   `Expiration Date` Time  
    ##   <chr>  <date>            <time>
    ## 1 apple  2018-09-26        01:00 
    ## 2 orange 2018-10-02        13:00 
    ## 3 durian 2018-10-21        11:00

## Exercise 2. Weather station

This dataset contains the weather and air quality data collected by a
weather station in Taiwan. It was obtained from the Environmental
Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan).

#### 2.1 Variable descriptions

- The text file
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/2015y_Weather_Station_notes.txt`
  contains descriptions of different variables collected by the station.

- Import it into R and print it in a table as shown below with
  `kable()`.

<br>

| Item       | Unit    | Description                                               |

| WS_HR      | m/sec   | Wind speed (The average of hour)                          |

`#` indicates invalid value by equipment inspection  
`*` indicates invalid value by program inspection  
`x` indicates invalid value by human inspection  
`NR` indicates no rainfall  
blank indicates no data

#### 2.2 Data tidying

- Import
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/2015y_Weather_Station.csv`
  into R. As you can see, this dataset is a classic example of untidy
  data: values of a variable (i.e. hour of the day) are stored as column
  names; variable names are stored in the `item` column.

- Clean this dataset up and restructure it into a tidy format.

- Parse the `date` variable into date format and parse `hour` into time.

- Turn all invalid values into `NA` and turn `NR` in rainfall into `0`.

- Parse all values into numbers.

- Show the first 6 rows and 10 columns of this cleaned dataset, as shown
  below, *without* using `kable()`.

*Hints: you don’t have to perform these tasks in the given order; also,
warning messages are not necessarily signs of trouble.*

#### 2.3 Using this cleaned dataset, plot the daily variation in ambient temperature on September 25, 2015, as shown below.

![](assignment_6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

#### 2.4 Plot the daily average ambient temperature throughout the year with a **continuous line**, as shown below.

![](assignment_6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

#### 2.5 Plot the total rainfall per month in a bar chart, as shown below.

*Hint: separating date into three columns might be helpful.*

![](assignment_6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

#### 2.6 Plot the per hour variation in PM2.5 in the first week of September with a **continuous line**, as shown below.

*Hint: uniting the date and hour and parsing the new variable might be
helpful.*

## Exercise 3. Camera data (OPTIONAL)

This dataset contains information on 1038 camera models. It was obtained
from the following website:
<https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/>

<br>

#### 3.1 Split brand names and model names

- Import
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/camera.csv`
  to R.

- You will see that the `Model` columns contains both the brand names
  and model names of cameras. Split this column into two, one with brand
  name, and the other with model name, as shown below.

- Print the first 6 rows of the new data frame with `kable()`.

*Hint: check the merge argument in `separate()`*

<br>

| Brand | Model             | Release date | Max resolution | Low resolution | Effective pixels | Zoom wide (W) | Zoom tele (T) | Normal focus range | Macro focus range | Storage included | Weight (inc. batteries) | Dimensions | Price |

#### 3.2 Split product line names and model names

- Many model names start with a name for the product line, which is then
  followed by a name for the particular model.

- Select all Canon cameras, and further split the model names into
  product line names (in this case, they are either “Powershot” or
  “EOS”) and model names.

- Show the first 6 lines of this new data frame with `kable()`.

*Hint: notice that there are more than one possible separators.*
