## Create a Website using Quarto and Github Pages

<br>

### Instructions: Please read through before you begin

#### This assignment is due by **10pm on Thursday 09/18/2025**.

Pair up with the classmate you worked with during lecture 5 and exchange
usernames of your personal Github accounts. If you missed lecture 5 or
for other reasons need a partner, let us know. You will have to
coordinate to do the first part of this exercise together; the second
part you can each do individually (but you’re also welcome to
collaborate!)

**Each of you** should complete the following steps:

- Create a new *public* repository in your personal Github account, name
  it **`assignment-3-NetID`** (make sure to change to your NetID -
  Nina’s repo will be `assignment-3-nt246`), and initialize with a
  README file.

- Clone this repository to your local computer through RStudio and turn
  it into a Quarto website project, as described in [lesson
  5](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/lesson5-collaboration-part2.html#Setting_up_your_collaborative_website)

- Activate a Github Pages website for the repo by following the
  instructions listed in [lesson
  5](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/lesson5-collaboration-part2.html#Setting_up_your_collaborative_website)

- Edit your website landing page (`index.qmd`) to it includes at least
  the following

  - A title

  - Your name and the name of your collaborator with links to your
    personal Github accounts

  - An image with a caption

- Edit your `about.qmd` to include the following:

  - Your first name as the title
  - An unordered list of some information about you, including at least
    3 bullet points
  - 

- Save and build your website (if you don’t see the Build pane, try
  restarting RStudio)

- Sync back to Github, remembering to follow these steps:

- Check your repo on Github to make sure it synced properly.

- Navigate to your repo settings on Github, select the *Collaborators
  and team* tab and invite your collaborator.

- Check your email (the one linked to your personal Github account) to
  accept an invitation from your collaborator.

- Navigate to your partner’s repo on Github and clone their repository
  to your local computer through RStudio, just like you did your own.

- Make some changes to your partner’s repo and push them

> This minimal setup satisfies the requirements for the assignment.
> However, we strongly encourage you to update the appearance of your
> website by changing the output theme [(reviewed in Lesson
> 5)](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/lesson5-collaboration-part2.html#Adding_content_and_editing_the_website).
> You may also include more content on your page(s), add more pages,
> change the styling and make other edits. **NOTE:** You are working
> independently at this point, so each of you can customize your website
> however you like.

<br>

To submit, paste the URL to your website to the README file in your
course repo. Below the table used to record grades, please type

`Assignment 3: URL-to-website` \[replacing `URL-to-website` with the
actual URL to your published website\].

We will look at your website, and from its URL, we can find the
associated repo and examine your commit history to confirm that your
partner successfully pushed a page to your site.

**Please make sure to have your website ready and have posted the URL by
the assignment deadline**
