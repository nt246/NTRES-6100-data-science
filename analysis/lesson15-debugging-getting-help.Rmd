## Readings

* Look over the [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for inspiration - **you don't have to read the whole guide carefully**

<br>
Today, Erika Mudrak from the Cornell Statistical Consultation Unit will give a guest lecture. Her slides are available [here](https://github.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/blob/main/slides/Getting%20Help%20in%20Stats%202023.pdf)

From [R for Excel users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/collaborating.html#getting-help):

> Getting help, or really helping you help yourself, means moving beyond “it’s not working” and towards solution-oriented approaches. Part of this is the mindset where you **expect that someone has encountered this problem before** and that **most likely the problem is your typo or misuse**, and not that R is broken or hates you.

There is excellent advice for trouble-shooting R-code and how to get help in [Lecture 2 from ESM 206: Statistics and Data Analysis in Environmental Science and Management](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1DdhU_WTv1b-sbQgqVGAE-bA2Nq_Yym8BzcPW4lS3k/edit#slide=id.g619be0f969_0_27) by Allison Horst.

## Announcements

* Homework 7 is due tonight
* Reminder that we will have short students presentations during our final class on March 31 (details [here](https://github.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/blob/main/misc/student_presentations.md)) - start thinking about what you want to show the class

## A consistent coding style maximizes readability

Developing a consistent style in your coding, makes it a lot easier to read. Here is some inspiration:

* The [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
* A more [concise overview of the style Hadley Wickham uses](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) in his books "R for Data Science" and "Advanced R"
* There are also great tips for styling, organizing and optimizing your code in the blogpost [R Best Practices: R you writing the R way!](https://blog.quantinsti.com/r-best-practices-r-you-writing-the-r-way/?utm_campaign=News&utm_medium=Community&utm_source=DataCamp.com) by Milind Paradkar
* Many of the same principles are also summarized by JEFworks [here](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/)
