## Readings

<br>

#### Required: 

* [Chapter 10: Be the boss of your factors](https://stat545.com/factors-boss.html) in Jenny Bryan's STAT545 notes

* Skim the [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for inspiration - **you don't have to read the whole guide carefully**


<br>

#### Other resources:

* [Chapter 16](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors.html) in R for Data Science (2e)

<br>
<br>

## Announcements
* Reminder about the [end-of-class student presentations](https://github.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/blob/main/misc/student_presentations.md)* You will all have the opportunity to give a short presentation during our last class (required if you're taking the course for credit)

* From next week onwards (from Thursday 10/16 and through the rest of the course), we will unfortunately have to shift classrooms (due to a scheduling error in the course roster)
* Lectures will be in Morrison Hall 348
* Thursday labs will be in Warren Hall B73
* Friday labs will stay in the same room (Warren 101)

<br>
<br>


## Today's learning objectives
By the end of today's class, you should be able to:

* Describe key features of factor variables in R
* Manipulate factor levels to improve plots of categorical data

<br>
<br>

## Getting set up
Today, we will be working with the `gapminder` dataset that many of you have started exploring in the lab session a few weeks ago. 

The data in the `gapminder` package is a subset of the [Gapminder dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/?from=world#$chart-type=bubbles), which contains data on the health and wealth of nations over the past decades. It was pioneered by [Hans Rosling](https://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling), who is famous for describing the prosperity of nations over time through famines, wars and other historic events with this beautiful data visualization in his [2006 TED Talk: The best stats you've ever seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen):

<br>

We will primarily use a subset of the gapminder data included in the R package `gapminder`. So first we need to install that package and load it, along with the tidyverse. Then have a look at the data in `gapminder`


```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)  #install.packages("gapminder")

# For being able to compare plots side by side, I'm also going to use the gridExtra package today
library(gridExtra)  #install.packages("gridExtra")

```

<br>
<br>


## Better plots with factor level manipulation 

R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. As such, this data type looks like character data type from the outset, but it can contain additional information to manage the levels and the order (or sequence) of the categorical values. Factors are important for modeling, but are also helpful for reordering character vectors to improve display in graphics. 

We'll go over [Jenny Bryan's illustration](https://stat545.com/factors-boss.html) of how a few powerful functions from the `forcats` package can significantly improve our handling of factor variables and visualization of data with categorical variables. The code used in-class can be found [here](https://github.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/blob/main/misc/factors_in_lecture_code.R)
