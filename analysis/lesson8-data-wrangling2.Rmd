## Learning objectives

Last class, we learned how to use `dplyr` functions

* `filter()` for subsetting data with row logic
* `select()` for subsetting data variable- or column-wise
* Use piping (`|>`) to implement function chains

Today, we'll expand our data wrangling toolbox. By the end of today's class, you should be able to:

* Subset, rearrange, and summarize data with additional key `dplyr` functions:
  + Create new variables with functions of existing variables with `mutate()`
  + Reorder the rows with `arrange()`
  + Collapse many values down to a single summary with `summarize()` and `group_by()`
* Understand the basic differences between tidyverse and base R syntax

## Getting set up a reloading the Coronavirus dataset
Let's jump back in where we left off during last class. Let's first clear out our workspace so we start with a fresh session by clicking "Session" -> "Restart R". Then let's open the R-script we were using to take notes, pull from GitHub to make sure we have the most recent version. You can use this script to type along as we're working through demos today (if you want, it's also fine to just watch). 

Today we'll also practice combining text and code in R Markdown files, so we'll do our in-class exercises in an R Markdown file. Do you remember how to create a new RMarkdown file? Go File -> New File -> R Markdown. Then change the output to GitHub document either as you're setting up the file or by manually editing the YAML header to say `output: github_document`. Now, delete the boilerplate text after the first setup code chunk and copy today's exercise questions into your document from [here](https://github.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/blob/main/in_class_exercises/lesson8-in-class-exercises.md). As we work through the exercises, you will want to add a code chunk under each question to complete your answer.

Finally, load the Coronavirus dataset back in directly from the GitHub URL and see whether it has been updated - what is the latest date included?

```{r, eval = TRUE, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)     ## install.packages("tidyverse")
library(skimr)        ## install.packages("skimr")

```

```{r, eval = TRUE, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# read in the coronavirus.csv file

coronavirus <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv')

```

Let's remind ourselves of the data structure and content
```{r, eval = FALSE}
skim(coronavirus)

```

## Warm up - Exercise 1: Piping together `select()` and `filter()` commands

Subset the coronavirus dataset to only include the daily counts of confirmed cases in countries located above 60 degree latitude. What are those countries?

If you have time, pipe it into ggplot() to visualize the trends over time in these countries.

<br>

#### Answer

<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# One way to do this:

coronavirus |> 
  filter(lat > 60, type == "confirmed") |> 
  select(country) |> 
  table()


coronavirus |> 
  filter(lat > 60, type == "confirmed") |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y = cases, color = country))

# If you try to plot the counts by date, you may see a very rugged pattern for Canada because case counts here are reported for different provinces. To get total daily counts by country we'll have to first group_by country and date and then summarize the counts, as outlined below.

## `mutate()` adds new variables

Alright, let's keep going. 

Besides selecting sets of existing columns, it’s often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. That’s the job of `mutate()`.

Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 

![](assets/rstudio-cheatsheet-mutate.png)

The current variables in the coronavirus dataset don't lend themselves well to cross-computation, so to illustrate the power of the `mutate()` function, let's look at the companion dataset from the [coronavirus package](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) on global vaccination statistics.

Details about the dataset can be found on the README file [here](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus), and the raw .csv dataset is available here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/covid19_vaccine.csv   
(you can also navigate to it from the `cvs` subdirectory and click `View raw` to get the URL)

<br>

Let's first load in the data the same way we did for the case counts dataset

```{r}
vacc <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/main/csv/covid19_vaccine.csv")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Let's have a look at this 
View(vacc) # remember to run this only from the console or an R script. Don't put this command in an .Rmd file that you're going to knit

```

<br>

This dataset has statistics on the *cumulative* number of vaccine doses administered and number of people vaccinated on each day in different countries. For now, let's just look at the most recent day included in the dataset `r max(vacc$date)`. 

Imagine we want to compare the vaccination rate across countries. We can divide the `people_at_least_one_dose` column with the `population` column to create a new column named `vaxxrate`. We do this with `mutate()` that is a function that defines and inserts new variables into a tibble. You can refer to existing variables diretly by name (i.e. without the `$` operator). To make it easier to see what happens, we'll also select just a subset of the variables to retain from our dataset.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vacc |> 
  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(vaxxrate = people_at_least_one_dose / population) 

# We can modify the mutate equation in many ways. For example, if we want to adjust the number of significant digits printed, we can type
vacc |> 
  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(vaxxrate = round(people_at_least_one_dose / population, 2))
```


<br>

### Your turn - Exercise 2

> Add a new variable that shows how many doses of vaccine on average have been distributed per person considered fully vaccinated for each country. First look the patterns across all countries, then only show data for countries that have distributed more than 200 million doses. How many countries is that?

# We can scroll through the output and eyeball patterns, but we can also pipe the output directly into ggplot!
vacc |> 
  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, doses_admin, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(doses_per_vaxxed = doses_admin / people_at_least_one_dose)  |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = doses_per_vaxxed))


# To subset the output, we can add another filter step

  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, doses_admin, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(doses_per_vaxxed = doses_admin / people_at_least_one_dose) |> 
  filter(doses_admin > 200 * 10^6)

 
# We can also use this to identify outliers in our histogram above
vacc |> 
  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, doses_admin, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(doses_per_vaxxed = doses_admin / people_at_least_one_dose)  |> 
  filter(doses_per_vaxxed > 3)

## `arrange()` orders rows

For examining the output of our previous calculations, we may want to re-arrange the countries in ascending or descending order for vaccination rate. The `dplyr` function for sorting rows is `arrange()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

vacc |> 
  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, doses_admin, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(doses_per_vaxxed = doses_admin / people_at_least_one_dose)  |> 
  arrange(doses_per_vaxxed)

# or

vacc |> 
  filter(date == max(vacc$date)) |> 
  select(country_region, continent_name, doses_admin, people_at_least_one_dose, population) |> 
  mutate(doses_per_vaxxed = doses_admin / people_at_least_one_dose)  |> 
  arrange(-doses_per_vaxxed)

```

I advise that your analyses NEVER rely on rows or variables being in a specific order. But it’s still true that human beings write the code and the interactive development process can be much nicer if you reorder the rows of your data as you go along. Also, once you are preparing tables for human eyeballs, it is imperative that you step up and take control of row order.

<br>

## Grouped summaries with `summarize()` and `group_by`

The last key `dplyr` verb is `summarize()`. It collapses a data frame to a single row. Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 
 
![](assets/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png)

We can use it to calculate the total number of confirmed cases detected globally since 1-22-2020 (the beginning of this dataset)
```{r, eval = FALSE}

coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "confirmed") |> 
  summarize(sum = sum(cases))

```

<br>

This number could also easily have been computed with base-R functions. In general, `summarize()` is not terribly useful unless we pair it with `group_by()`. This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. Then, when you use the `dplyr` verbs on a grouped data frame they’ll be automatically applied “by group”. For example, if we applied exactly the same code to a data frame grouped by country, we get the total number of confirmed cases for each country or region.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "confirmed") |>
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases))

```
Now that's a lot more useful!

<br>
<br>

We can also use `summarize()` to check how many observations (dates) we have for each country

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 
coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "confirmed") |>
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarize(n = n())

```

Why do some countries have much higher counts than others?

<br>

We can also do multi-level grouping. If we wanted to know how many of each type of case there were globally on Jan 1, 2023, we could chain these functions together:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
coronavirus |> 
  group_by(date, type) |> 
  summarize(total = sum(cases)) |>  # sums the count across countries
  filter(date == "2023-01-01")

```

<br>
<br>

## Your turn - Exercise 5
Which day has had the highest total death count globally reported in this dataset?

<br>

Pipe your global daily death counts into ggplot to visualize the trend over time.

<br>
<br>

#### Answer
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r, eval = FALSE}

coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "death") |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(total_deaths = sum(cases)) |> 
  arrange(-total_deaths)

# Or

coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "death") |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(total_deaths = sum(cases)) |> 
  filter(total_deaths == max(total_deaths))

# With plotting

coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "death") |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(total_deaths = sum(cases)) |> 
  arrange(-total_deaths) |> 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(x = date, y = total_deaths))

## We see that the last day of the dataset has a much higher reported count than all other dates, so let's remove that

coronavirus |> 
  filter(type == "death", date != "2023-01-04") |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(total_deaths = sum(cases)) |> 
  arrange(-total_deaths) |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = total_deaths))

```

## If you have more time, here is an optional question

  filter(type == "death", month == 2, year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarize(total_death = sum(cases)) |> 
  filter(total_death > 10000)
