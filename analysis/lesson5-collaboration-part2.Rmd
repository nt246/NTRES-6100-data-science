## Plan for today

We will continue practicing how to collaborate on a GitHub repo - now while setting up a free website through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! Because we may not have both partners from all the pairs we formed last week with us today, we will form new pairs and start over with setting up a new shared repo that both partners will each clone to their local computers. It's good to keep practicing that setup, and we'll quickly get back to where we left off.

<br>

## Learning objectives

Like last class, we will focus on the simplest way to collaborate on GitHub by both partners having full write access to the repo. There are many ways to improve this workflow once you get more comfortable, but this is a good place to start.

By the end of today's class, you should be able to:  

* Set up a new repo on GitHub and invite collaborators  
* Clone the repo to your local machine through RStudio  
* Work in parallel with a collaborator on files in a repo (both of you pushing changes)  
* Set up a free website through RStudio with GitHub pages  
* Control basic aspects of the design and styling of a GitHub pages website  

<br>

## A recap on common issues experienced so far and how to deal with them

<br>

#### Problems:

<br>

* Partner 1 not pushing the `.Rproj` and `.gitignore` files they create when initially cloning their repo before Partner 2 clones. In this case, Partner 2 will create these files on their computer so you will have two different copies and get merge conflicts 

<br>

* Not being in the R Project you think you're in (i.e. not pushing changes to the GitHub repo you think you're pushing changes to)

<br>

* Committing and pushing before you have saved your most recent changes (Git will work with your most recently saved version, and not include any unsaved changes you have made in RStudio)

<br>

* Not knowing how to get non-RStudio files onto GitHub (just add them to your GitHub link folder in Finder/Windows Explorer. These are just like any other folder on your computer; they have some added functionality, but don't need special handling) 

<br>

* Getting overwhelmed by the Git error messages and feeling like the program is not letting you do any of the steps (pull, stage, commit, push). The error messages are your friend. Take a pause and read the message - it should indicate what the problem is.



<br>
<br>

If you get stuck with git error messages that you can't make sense of or resolve, "a highly inelegant, but effective technique for disaster recovery" (in Jenny Bryan's words) is to [burn it all down](https://happygitwithr.com/burn) and clone a fresh copy of your repo.

<br>
<br>


## Now, let's get set up for today's exercise

There are several different ways we can set up a website with Quarto. To keep practicing the workflow we used during last class, we'll here use a "GitHub first" approach (see details about other ways to set up Quarto website projects at the end of this lesson). 

We also want to keep practicing collaboration, so we'll again split into teams. Because everyone will have a new partner today, we'll practice one more time how to

* Create a new repo
* Invite a collaborator

When you get paired up, decide who will be Partner 1 and Partner 2. 
Partner 1 starts by creating a repo. You can call it `collab-website`. Add Partner 2 as a collaborator, as described in [giving your partner privileges section from Lesson 4](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/lesson4-collaboration.html#Give_your_collaborator_(Partner_2)_privileges). 

Now, both of you should clone the collaborative repo to your local machines (check [Lesson 4](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/lesson4-collaboration.html#Collaborating_with_GitHub) if you need a reminder of how to do this).

**NOTE: Make sure Partner 2 doesn't clone the repo until Partner 1 has pushed their `.RProj` file to avoid merge conflicts here.**

<br>

## Setting up your collaborative website

Now it's going to get fun. Let's start by making a super simple website. Quarto has built-in functionality to create all the basic files we need for a simple website. Unfortunately, there is no way to access that functionality through point-and-click in the RStudio GUI or a single command in the R Console (since Quarto is fundamentally a command-line tool). So instead we will have to run the command in the Terminal tab (in the bottom left left) [i.e. NOT in the Console tab]

In the Terminal tab, have Partner 2 type and run the following command:

`quarto create-project --type website`  

[only Partner 2 should do this]

This adds the the default files (`_quarto.yml`, `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`, and  `styles.css`) that we need for getting started on our website. 

Check to see if a Build tab now shows up in your top right pane:

<img src="assets/rstudio-build-tab.png" width="450px"> 

<br>

If not, try closing your RStudio Project and re-open it (e.g. by clicking File -> Open Project in New Session)

<img src="assets/rstudio-open-project.png" width="250px"> 

<br>

That should bring up the Build pane, so you can click Render Website

<img src="assets/rstudio-render-website.png" width="450px"> 

<br>

This will render our very basic, but functional website. It should pop up in your Viewer tab in the bottom left pane, and you can open it in a browser by clicking the "show in new window" icon.

<img src="assets/rstudio-website-preview.png" width="450px"> 

<br>

After you have previewed your website, have Partner 2 push the changes to Github.

<br>
<br>


## Build & prepare to publish your site with GitHub Pages

There are many ways to publish a Quarto website (more details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/)). We will use [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), which allows you to publish a website from any GitHub repository (for free!). To do so, there are a few configuration steps that we will have Partner 1 set up.

**Step 1**  

Create a file named `.nojekyll` in your repository’s root directory (e.g. `collab-website/`), which is required to disable some processing of HTML files that GitHub does by default. From RStudio’s Files pane, click New File > Text File, then type .nojekyll > click OK (you can use the Text File option to create any file type).

<br>
**Step 2**  

Open the `_quarto.yml` file and edit the header to set the output directory to a subdirectory named `docs` [it's important that you use exactly this name] by adding the line `output-dir: docs` under the project section, so the file contents will look like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
  
website:
  title: "collab-website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme:
      - cosmo
      - brand
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

<br>
**Step 3**  

Save your changes and render your website again by clicking "Render Website" under the Build tab in the top right pane. You will see a `docs` folder appear, which is where all your rendered .html (and other important) files will automatically be saved to when you “Build” your website – that is, when you convert all your .qmd files to the .html files that your web browser can interpret / display.

>Note: your website is currently being hosted by your local machine, not at a searchable URL. We’ll get there soon though!

But first, Partner 1 must stage, commit, and push their changes to GitHub.

<br>
<br>

## Configure your GitHub Pages setup to launch your website

1. Go to your new collaborative repo on Github
2. Navigate to the repo settings, then select the Pages tab from the left-hand menu bar
3. Make sure that Branch is set to `main` and that the selected folder is set to `/docs`. **Remember to click save** (on the same line as you chose the main branch as the source).

<img src="assets/ghpages-settings-docs.png" width="450px"> 

<br>

Your repo is now a website! After a few minutes it will go live and you can see the URL inside a box at the top of the page (you may have to try refreshing a few times).

<img src="assets/github_pages_live.png" width="450px"> 

<br>

We would also have figured out our website's URL from your GitHub repo's URL — pay attention to URLs.    

- note that the url starts with my **username.github.io**   
- my github repo: <https://github.com/nt246/collab-website/>
- my website URL: <https://nt246.github.io/collab-website/>

    
> ***ProTip*** Pay attention to URLs. An unsung skill of the modern analyst is to be able to navigate the internet by keeping an eye on patterns.
    
### So cool!! You've just set up an actual website in just a few minutes!  

**Note  that it may take a few minutes before your changes become active.**. So don't despair if you don't see your changes showing up right away. Just double-check that you've pushed the rendered site and check back. In the meantime, you can explore your current website content and design in RStudio's Viewer in the bottom left pane. 

Make sure that the Partner who didn't render the website locally pulls the updated version from GitHub.

<br>
<br>

## Adding content and editing the website

Now take turns to edit the contents and looks of your website, following [Samantha Csik's excellent tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/#change-stuff).

Remember to push and pull frequently, and resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

<br>
<br>

## Inspiration

Today, we'll just explore the basics, but GitHub pages is a tremendously powerful platform for building beautiful websites with advanced graphic layout and lots of different kinds of functionality. 

**Here are a few examples:**

[Our class website](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/index.html)

<br>

And some personal websites:

<br>

And of course the [GitHub Pages site](https://pages.github.com/) itself

## Learning more

We are now at the end of the GitHub-focused section of the course. You should now be comfortable with using some of the basic functionality of Git and version control and the skills that you have learned - and that we will continue to practice through the rest of the course - may serve all your version control needs for a long time to come.

We have focused on the simplest way to start using GitHub here. Once you really integrate GitHub into your workflow, you may want to learn about more advanced options or special use scenarios. Here, Google is going to be your best friend. You may want to learn about topics like:

* Forking vs. cloning a repo
* Branches
* Pull requests
* How to "check out" older versions of your repo
* GitHub Projects
* Using Issues on GitHub (see this awesome Openscapes tutorial on [using GitHub for project management](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/github/github-issues.html))

One important thing to note is that we have exclusively interacted with Git through RStudio because that provides a really nice interface and integrates well with RMarkdown and other work in R. However, there are some limits to the functionality, so for more advanced usage you will probably have to either use the [GitHub Desktop program](https://desktop.github.com/) or interact with Git and GitHub through the command line.

A few good resources for learning about interacting with Git through the command line are:

* [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

* [Chapter 4 Git, GitHub and RMarkdown in MacLachlan and Dennett's CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science handbook](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/git-github-and-rmarkdown.html#using-git-outside-rstudio)

* [Ohshitgit](https://ohshitgit.com/)

Have fun exploring!
