## Goal for today

Explore more Quarto functionality and practice implementing it.

<br> <br>

## Exercise 1: Basic formatting and code chunk options

Let's start by playing around with the basic RStudio Quarto template a
little more. Open a fresh copy by clicking File -\> New File -\>
Quarto... We can enter "Lab exercise" in the Title field and keep HTML
as the Default Output Format.

<br>

### Basic formatting

Let's play around with the formatting of our document. Remember that you
can find RStudio's built-in Quarto reference under Help \> Cheat Sheets
\> Browse Cheat Sheets ... and find Quarto Cheat Sheet, or check out one
of the many great cheatsheets you can find online, e.g.
[this](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/quarto-cheat-sheet-previously-known-as-r-markdown)
or RStudio's Quarto cheatsheet you can download from
[here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (scroll down to find
it).

As you're making changes, knit often and see how your edits look in the
rendered document.

Some ideas of what you can try:

<br>

#### Add different header levels

Compare the output with different numbers of `#` in headers

<br>

#### Blank space

Add empty lines `<br>`

<br>

#### In-line code

Another really cool and useful functionality is writing in-line code.
Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .qmd file by
enclosing the code with `r`. This way, you're basically running code
inside a sentence. Quarto will always display the results of in-line
code, but not the code, and apply relevant text formatting to the
results. As a result, inline output is indistinguishable from the
surrounding text, but will show up-to-date results of your code. However, we 
first need to add an additional option to the header YAML of our Quarto document.

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Example"
format: html
engine: knitr #Add this to your YAML header
---
```


Once this is done, we may for example want to summarize the dimensions of our dataset. We
can do this by typing

```{r, eval = FALSE}
There are `{r} nrow(cars)` observations in the cars dataset, 
and `{r} ncol(cars)` variables.
```

See how that renders.

<br>

#### Add images

In addition to figures generated through R code in our code chunks, it's
easy to also add other images, e.g. jpg or png files that you have
stored on your computer or find online.

There are two ways we can do this:

1.  With markdown syntax
2.  With `knitr::include_graphics()`

<br>

The **markdown syntax** to insert an image is:
`![caption]("path/to/image")`

The path can either be a path to an image stored on your computer, or it
can be a URL to an image stored online. If you want to get the URL to an
image you find, right click and select "Copy Image Address".

<br>

Using *knitr::include_graphics()*: If you want more control over the
output, e.g. to center the image or make it smaller, you can use
`knitr::include_graphics()`, and control the figure size using options
such as `out.width` and `fig.align` and add a caption with fig.cap. More
details
[here](http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/)

<br>

#### Center and right align text

You cannot align text with the native markdown syntex. However,
depending on the output format, you can use other methods. For example,
if you are knitting the Quarto file into an HTML file, you can use HTML
tags such as the following:

```         
<center> Centered text (HTML) </center>
[Aligned right (HTML)]{style="float:right"}
```

Alternatively, if you are knitting the Quarto file into a PDF file, you
can use LaTeX commands. E.g.,

```         
\center Centered text (PDF) \center
\hfill Aligned right (PDF)
```

<br>

#### Equations

Want to include equations in your writing? Easy. Quarto supports LaTeX
style equation writing. We won't go through this in class, but you can
find an easy introduction in [R Markdown for
Scientists](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/math.html).

<br>

### Code-chunk options

Remind yourself about the key code chunk options, see overview
[here](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/lesson2-Quarto-github.html#Code_chunks)

1.  Add a few new code chunks to your document. Name them, add some
    simple code. Knit and see how the document renders.

2.  Now try changing the code chunk options. Explore the settings to
    show code, show output, execute output vs not etc.

3.  Now explore the first code chunk titled `setup`. What happens if you
    change it to `echo = FALSE`? Or if you add `eval = FALSE`? Why does
    this happen?

<br> <br>

## Exercise 2: Document styling and output formats

### Add table of contents

Add toc details to your YAML header <br>

```         
---
title: "Lab1_doc"
author: "Nina"
date: "2/12/2021"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
```

More details about styling your table of contents
[here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/Quarto/html-document.html#table-of-contents)

<br> <br>

### Output formats

Up until now, we've been rendering our .Rmd file to the default html
format. That's useful for lots of applications. But lots of other output
formats are supported.

Check what happens if you change the `format: html` in the YAML
header to `format: docx`

Now, check what happens if you change it to `format: pdf`. In
order to convert the documents to PDF, they use a software called LaTeX
(pronounced la-tek or lay-tek).

Installing LaTeX can be a pain, but thankfully there is an easier way to
install it - tinytex. tinytex is an R package that installs a sane,
lightweight (\<200Mb) version of LaTeX.

Just go to your `Terminal` tab in Rstudio and type:

`quarto install tinytex`

If you're having trouble with the generating the pdf, see the note on
installing `tinytex`
[here](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/installation.html#a-note-on-pdf).

<br>

We can also make slides! There are several slide output formats. Try
`format: beamer`

<br>

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

<br>

<br> <br>

## Exercise 3: Make a CV

Now, practice what youâ€™ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title
should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least)
education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted
list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold and add a footnote. You
can also add a photo, either of yourself, or something else you have
handy or can find online.

Render to html format, and if you're comfortable, share with the class
by posting it to the `lecture-chat` channel in Slack.

You will have seen how quickly you can create a nicely formatted
document. But there are also lots of great CV templates out there that
we can use. You could, for example, try one of these:
<br>
<https://github.com/mps9506/quarto-cv/tree/main>
<br>
<https://alexbass.me/posts/resume/>
<br>
<https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-cv?tab=readme-ov-file>

<br> <br>

## Exercise 4: Explore other Quarto applications

Quarto can be used for much more than making simple documents. In small
groups, explore examples of interactive documents, dashboards, books,
websites, rticles, and more. You can find examples of all of these in
the [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)

Discuss in your groups which application you think is the coolest, and
report back to the group.
