## Goals for today

1. Continue to practice data visualization with `ggplot2`
 
2. Continue to practice data transformation with `dplyr`

3. Integrate 1) and 2) to explore the `gapminder` dataset

<br>
<br>

## General instructions

* Today, we'll combine the powerful data transformation tools in `dplyr` and the data visualization tools in `ggplot2` to explore global trends in public health and economics compiled by the [Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/about/).

<br>

* To start, first open a new Quarto file in your course repo,  set the output format to `github_document`, save it in your `lab` folder as `lab4.Rmd`, and work in this Quarto file for the rest of this lab. 

<br>

* We will work with the `gapminder` dataset provided in the R package `dslabs`. Let's start by installing the `dslabs` package if you don't have it installed already. Then, we need to load it with the `library()` function. We also need to load the `tidyverse` package because it contains ggplot.

<br>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs) #install.packages("dslabs")

# After you have loaded the dslabs package, you can access the data stored in `gapminder`. Let's look at the top 5 lines 
gapminder %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  head(5)
```

<br>

* As a reminder, to get familar with this dataset, you might want to use functions like `View()`, `dim()`, `colnames()` , and `?`. You will see that the dataset includes the following variables:

    - country
    - year
    - infant_mortality (infant deaths per 1000)
    - life_expectancy
    - fertility (average number of children per woman)
    - population (per country)
    - gpd (per country)
    - continent
    - region (geographical region)

<br>
<br>

## Exercise 1: Use data transformation and visualization to answer the following questions (45 min)

<br>

Today, we'll use ggplot to visually explore global trends in public health and economics compiled by the [Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/about/). This project was pioneered by [Hans Rosling](https://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling), who is famous for describing the prosperity of nations over time through famines, wars and other historic events with this beautiful data visualization in his [2006 TED Talk: The best stats you've ever seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen):

The mission of the Gapminder Project is to "fight devastating ignorance with a fact-based worldview everyone can understand". Per their own description, Gapminder identifies systematic misconceptions about important global trends and proportions and uses reliable data to develop easy to understand teaching materials to rid people of their misconceptions.

Several of the questions posted below have been borrowed from their [ignorance test](https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/ignorance-test/).

You may first answer these questions based on your intuition, and then use the `gapminder` dataset to verify if your intuition is correct, either with a summary table of the relevant statistics or with a visualization (ideally both!).

We provide one possible solution for each question, but we highly recommend that you **don't look at them unless you are really stuck**.

<br>
<br>

### Question 1: Which five countries had the largest population size in 2015 (the most recent year for which population sizes are included in this dataset), and how has the population sizes in those countries changes since 1960?

<br>

  select(country) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  pull()

gapminder %>%

### Question 4. If you break down the relationship between per-capita GDP and fertility rate by continent, which continent (or regions) stands out as an outlier? (Bonus question: why might this be?)

A. Africa  
B. Asia  
C. Europe

## Exercise 2: Use data transformation and visualization to explore the following open-ended question (40 min)

<br>

This question is borrowed from the excellent [Chapter 9 in Rafael A. Irizarry's Introduction to Data Science book](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/gapminder.html)

<br>

### Explore how much the gap in infant mortality, life expectancy, and per capita GDP between Western countries and the rest of the world have changed from 1960 to 2010. 

<br>

Suggestions:

* Visualizing the entire time series and taking certain snapshots of time (e.g. one data point every decade) can both be useful approaches.

* The range in per capita GDP can be very high, with most countries having low values but a few countries having very high values, so a log transformation may be useful.

* You can try different definitions of "Western countries" and the "rest of the world".

* You can also analyze different subgroups within the broad categorizations of "Western countries" and the "rest of the world" separately.

* Try to explore different geometric objects. Line plot, scatter plot, density plot, box plot, bar plot, and others can all be useful.

<br> 

*Some ideas if you are really stuck*
