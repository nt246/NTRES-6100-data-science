## Goals for today

1. Practice data tidying with `tidyr`

2. Continue to practice data visualization with `ggplot2`
 
3. Continue to practice data transformation with `dplyr`

4. Integrate 1), 2), and 3) to explore the `whales` dataset\* and the `babynames` dataset

    \* *Borrowed from Iain Carmichaelâ€™s [STOR 390 course](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/course_info/syllabus.html).*

<br>
<br>

## General instructions

* Today, we will combine the data transformation tools in `dplyr`, the data visualization tools in `ggplot2`, and the data tidying tools in `tidyr` to explore the patterns and trends in the `whales` dataset and the `babynames` dataset. 

<br>

* To start, first open a new Quarto file in your course repo, set the output format to `github_document`, save it in your `lab` folder as `lab6.qmd`, and work in this Quarto file for the rest of this lab.

## Exercise 1: Whale observation (40 min)

<br>

Tidy up the messy `whales` dataset.

<br>

![](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/11/0d/1a/110d1a40a4dd81e60395e559297cb776.jpg)

<br>
<br>

**Instructions:**

* Read in the data with the following code:

<br>

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

# Read in the data
whales <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/main/datasets/whales.csv")
whales |> head() |> kable()
```

<br>

* The `whales` dataset is a classic example of messy datasets. It was collected as follows: observers are asked for certain information about specific indicents they witnessed of ships striking whales and that information is compiled by whale type. The observers were asked to provide: type of whale, date of event (m/d/yr), outcome of event, approximate length of whale in feet, ocean in which event occurred.

<br>

* Sometimes an observer could not provide all of that information, and missing data is represented as blanks between commas; look at the dataset to see. An observer can possibly give information about more than one event.

<br>

* As a reminder, to get familar with this dataset, you might want to use functions like `View()`, `dim()`, `colnames()` , and `?`. 

<br>

* We provide some possible solutions for each question, but we highly recommend that you **don't look at them unless you are really stuck**.

<br>
<br>

#### Question 1. Create a new data frame that has one row per observer, per species and one single variable of all the information collected. Name this data frame `whales_long`.

<br> 

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
whales_long <- whales |>
  pivot_longer(-1, names_to = "species", values_to = "info")
whales_long |> head() |> kable()
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

#### Question 2. Starting from `whales_long`, create another data frame that includes only events for which there is information. Name this data frame `whales_clean`.

<br>

*Hint: `is.na()` might be helpful.*

<br> 

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
whales_clean <- whales_long |>
  filter(!is.na(info))
whales_clean |> head() |> kable()
```

</details>

<br>
<br>


#### Question 3. Starting from `whales_clean`, create another data frame with one variable per type of information, one piece of information per cell. Some cells might be empty. Name this data frame `whales_split`.

<br>

Your new data frame should have six variables: observer, species, date, outcome, size, ocean.

<br> 

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
whales_split <- whales_clean |>
  separate(info, c("date", "outcome", "size", "ocean"), ",")
whales_split |> head() |> kable()
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

#### Question 4. Starting from `whales_split`, create another data frame in which all columns are parsed as instructed below. Name this data frame `whales_parsed`.

<br>

The columns should parsed to the following types  
* `observer`: double  
* `species`: character  
* `date`: date  
* `outcome`: character  
* `size`: integer  
* `ocean`: character  

<br> 

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
whales_parsed <- whales_split |>
  type_convert(
    col_types = cols(
      date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"),
      size = col_integer()
    )
  )
whales_parsed |> head()
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

#### Question 5. Using `whales_parsed`, print a summary table with: 1) number ship strikes by species, 2) average whale size by species, omitting NA values in the calculation.

<br> 

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
whales_parsed |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(number_of_ship_strikes = n(), average_size = mean(size, na.rm = T))  |>
  kable()
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

#### Question 6. Try to summarize as much information contained in `whales_parsed` as possible in one plot. 

<br>

What are some challenges in this?

<br>

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
whales_parsed |>
  mutate(ocean = ifelse(ocean == "artic", "arctic", ocean)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y = size, color=outcome)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(ocean~species)
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

**Instructions:**

* Load the required packages and read in the data with the following code:

<br>

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(babynames) # install.packages("babynames")

babynames |> head() |> kable()
```

<br>

* The `babynames` dataset provides the number of children of each sex given each name from 1880 to 2017 in the US. All names with more than 5 uses are included. This dataset is provided by the US Social Security Administration.

<br>

* As a reminder, to get familar with this dataset, you might want to use functions like `View()`, `dim()`, `colnames()` , and `?`. 

<br>

* Make sure that you use figures and/or tables to support your answer.

<br>

* We provide some possible solutions for each question, but we highly recommend that you **don't look at them unless you are really stuck**.

<br>
<br>

#### Question 1: What are the 6 most popular boy names and girl names of all time? How has the popularity of each of these names changed over time?

<br>

*Hint: You can start by finding the 6 most popular names for each sex separately.*

<br>

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
# number of passengers in the dataset
top_6_boy_names <- babynames |>
  filter(sex == "M") |>
  group_by(name) |>
  summarise(total_count=sum(n)) |>
  slice_max(order_by = total_count, n = 6)

top_6_girl_names <- babynames |>
  filter(sex == "F") |>
  group_by(name) |>
  summarise(total_count=sum(n)) |>
  slice_max(order_by = total_count, n = 6) 

babynames |>
  filter(
    (name %in% top_6_boy_names$name & sex == "M") | (name %in% top_6_girl_names$name & sex == "F")
    ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=prop, group=name, color=sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~name)
```

Note: 

* `slice_max(order_by = total_count, n = 6)` select 6 rows with the highest values in total_count; in this instance, using `arrange()` and `head()` is equivalent

* There will be a more efficient solution after you've learned relational data.

</details>

<br>
<br>

#### Question 2. What are the most popular boy names and girl names in each decade?

<br>

*Hint: You can create a new variable called `decade`. The `floor()` function may be helpful in this step.*

*Hint: To get the most popular names, `group_by()` in combination with `slice_max()` can be very efficient. *

<br>

*One possible solution*
<details>
  <summary>click to expand</summary>

```{r}
set.seed(42)
babynames |>
  mutate(decade = floor(year/10)*10) |>
  group_by(sex, decade, name) |>
  summarise(total_count = sum(n)) |>
  group_by(sex, decade) |>
  slice_max(order_by = total_count, n=1) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=decade, y=total_count, color=sex)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size = 3)+
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(label=name)) +
  cowplot::theme_cowplot()
```

Note: In this case, `slice_max()` cannot be replaced by `arrange()` and `head()`, because the latter does not work well with `group_by()`

</details>

<br>
<br>

#### Question 3. Continue to explore the `babynames` dataset.

<br>

**Suggested activities:**

* Polish your plots in Exercise 2. Try to put more thought into editing the aesthetics of your figures and tables to make them easier to understand and nicer to look at (e.g. choose the most appropriate geometric object, aesthetic mapping, facetting, position adjustment; add meaningful axis labels, figure titles, legend titles; change the background; be creative; etc.).

* Read the example code that we provided in Exercise 2. Make sure that you understand each line, and try to reproduce the output/computations on your own.

* Think of other interesting questions you can answer with this dataset and explore different strategies for getting your answer.
