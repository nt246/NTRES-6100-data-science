## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document *will be generated* that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

``` r
1 + 1
```

    [1] 2

You can add options to executable code like this

    [1] 4

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).

## **Trying formatting**

- point 1
- point 2
- point 3

| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |
|------|------|------|
| 2    | 4    |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
